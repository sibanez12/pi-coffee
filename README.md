## pi-coffee

This project is meant to provide access control to
a coffee machine using HID rfid smart cards (i.e.
student ID cards).

This code is designed to run on a raspberry pi 3 and
connects to an RF IDeas card reader and electrical
locking circuit.

Basically, if the user's ID card is registered with
the database then they are granted access to the coffee
machine.
